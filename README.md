# MyCounterApp
This is a simple counter app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter, and the current count is displayed on the screen.

Getting Started

How to Use
To increment the counter, click the "INCREMENT" button. To reset the counter to zero, click the "SAVe" button. The current count will be displayed on the screen.

Customization
You can customize the app by modifying the CSS. The buttons are styled using the .button class, and the counter is styled using the .count class.

The code for the app is split into three files:

index.html - contains the HTML markup for the app
index.css - contains the CSS styling for the app
index.js - contains the JavaScript logic for the app
